                    According to legend, Bhadrak derives its name from the Goddess Bhadrakali, whose temple is situated
                    on
                    the southwest outskirts of the town. It is an ancient land, dating from the age of the Puranas.[1]

                    Bhadrak's contribution to Odisha's maritime and agrarian prosperity, trade, and commerce throughout
                    the
                    ages is a part of history. In the Mughal period, Bhadrak was a subah, or province, under the Nawabs
                    of
                    Bengal. When the imperial power of the Mughals waned, the area consisted of principalities such as
                    Kanika, Nampo, and Agarapada, with administrative sub-units called chowparhies, all ruled by
                    Kshatriya
                    chiefs.[1]

                    After the occupation of Odisha by the British in June 1804, Bhadrak constituted one of the two
                    administrative divisions of Cuttack and Balasore. In 1828, when Balasore was made a separate
                    district,
                    Bhadrak became one of its sub-divisions with an assistant magistrate and deputy collector as the
                    sub-divisional head; but the munsif's court remained in Jajpur until 1901.
                    Bhadrak was at the forefront during the period of national struggle. In 1920, Mahatma Gandhi's
                    non-cooperation movement was launched. In March 1921, Gandhi visited Bhadrak, after being impressed
                    by
                    its nationalistic fervor and fighting spirit. In 1922, he started the rebellion of Kanika which
                    British
                    troops stationed at Bhadrak attempted to suppress; but ultimately the tenants' movement triumphed,
                    under
                    the leadership of Chakradhar Behera, the doyen of Kanika.
